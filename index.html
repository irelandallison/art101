			<h1>Ireland's Homepage</h1>
			<p>Hi! Thank's for visiting my homepage, this is my first website I've ever made using code and I'm excited to share it with you. </p>

					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Ireland Allison and I'm a student at UC Santa Cruz. I'm currently in my second year studying Education and Psychology. Growing up in San Diego, I've spent many hours in the ocean and have enjoyed finding my new favorite beaches in Northern California. My other hobbies include yoga, coloring, and having craft nights with my friends. I work part-time at Bayview Elementary as a Behavioral Aid with a first grade student. I'm working towards becoming an eductor or school counseler, hense the two degrees. A dream I have is to backpack through different countries because I've never left the United States.   </p>
