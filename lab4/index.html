			<h1> Lab 4: Psedocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to introduce pseudocoding, which is often used before actual coding takes place.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I didn't run into any problems on this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I enjoyed this lab a bit more than the previous because it teaches us about how to prepare for the coding process. As someone who is new to the field, it is nice to have a system to divide the coding into subsections.  </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h2> Pseudocoding for Making Banana Bread</h2>
					<p>1. Gather Ingredients and supplies
						1.1. Measure out:
						2 to 3 ripe bananas
						1/3 cup melted butter
						1 teaspoon baking soda
						Pinch of salt
						3/4 cup sugar (adjust to taste)

						2. Preheat the Oven
						2.1. Set the oven to 350Â°F to preheat.
						3. Prepare the Baking Pan
						3.1. Grease a 4x8-inch loaf pan with butter or nonstick spray.
						4. Mash the Bananas
						4.1. Peel the ripe bananas.
						4.2. Place them in a large mixing bowl.
						4.3. Mash the bananas using a fork until smooth.
						5. Mix Wet Ingredients
						5.1. Add the melted butter to the mashed bananas.
						5.2. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract until combined.
						6. Add Dry Ingredients
						6.1. Sprinkle the baking soda and a pinch of salt over the wet mixture.
						6.2. Stir in the flour gradually until all ingredients are fully combined.
						7. Pour the Batter into the Pan
						7.1. Pour the banana bread batter into the greased loaf pan.
						7.2. Smooth the top of the batter with a spatula if necessary.
						8. Bake the Banana Bread
						8.1. Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven.
						8.2. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
						9. Cool the Bread
						9.1. Once the bread is done, remove it from the oven.
						9.2. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
						9.3. Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool completely.
						10. Serve and Enjoy
						10.1. Once the bread has cooled, slice and serve.
						10.2. Optionally, spread butter or honey on each slice.</p>
