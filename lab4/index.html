			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to introduce pseudocoding, which is often used before actual coding takes place.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I didn't run into any problems on this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I enjoyed this lab a bit more than the previous because it teaches us about how to prepare for the coding process. As someone who is new to the field, it is nice to have a system to divide the coding into subsections.  </p>
