			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Ireland, and for this lab I am working with Trinity. She is a fourth year CS major and is orginally from San Francisco. Trinity is in a leader of the Asain American Christian Fellowship club at UCSC. I'm a second year EJD and General Psychology double major. In my freetime, I enjoying practicing yoga, coloring, and trying new coffee with friends. Trinity and I met through ART101 and have been partners for two labs so far. I'm not experienced with code at all so having Trinity as a knowledgable partner has been extremely helpful and I'm grateful for her support while I'm learning to navigate this new field.    </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to apply what we learned in lecture to our HTML program. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled creating new parapgraph bars, like the one I am typing in now, and understanding what all of the symbols mean. Trinity is experienced in coding so she was able to explain what I needed to do.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I found the assignment relatively challenging as someone who has never coded before. It has been frustrating to continously work on one element and still have the code be incorrect. I put a great deal of energy into this assignment although my website appears simplistic. It took me lots of time to craft each element of the HTML and CSS.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I am happy with my website's final look! Purple and green are two of my favorite colors and the black border around the page brings it all together nicely.  </p>
