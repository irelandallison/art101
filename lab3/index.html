					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we are working on intergrating images, lists, and decorative details into our webpages. Addtionally, we have linked files into our various webpages. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>During Thursday's lecture, I was following along in VS Code and Github when the internet began to fail. For the days to follow, my code would not push to origin. Thankfully, in Monday's section, my lab partner Trinity showed me how to fix my issue by installing resistant software.   </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I feel good with my work done on this assignment and am happy with the progress I've made over the last few weeks. It was defeating to have server issues so early on in the assignment, but since they have been resolved, things have been moving along smoothly.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I have sucessfully included an image of proper size, a list of linked files, and have decorated the page to my style. </p>
